### Analysis of baby name popularity after a landfalling named hurricane

#### Data:
====================
####1. `hurricanes.csv` - created from spreadsheet published with Jung et al. paper "Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes" http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/05/29/1402786111.abstract
##### Note : Data for Hurricane Katrina was not included in this data set. I added it separately. 

#### 2. Baby name data from `babynames` R package. https://github.com/hadley/data-baby-names

#### Code: 
====================
##### 1. `babyname.R` - to be posted shortly
##### 2. `babycanes.R - to be posted shortly
##### 3. `diff.vs.fatalities.R` - plots the change in baby name usage vs the fatalities for each hurricane in the hurricane dataset. Also plots linear regression line and 95% confidence area.
